Covid-19 Data Exploration (2020-2021)


Based on my analysis of COVID-19 data from (http://ourworldindata.org/), I have gained valuable insights into the varying levels of risk and impact associated with the virus. Examining the global scenario, the maximum chance of death when contracting COVID-19 was estimated to be 3.5958%, while the minimum chance was found to be 1.1054% based on the total number of deaths and cases recorded in India.

Furthermore, the analysis revealed significant variations in COVID-19 transmission rates across countries. For instance, Andorra exhibited the highest infection rate relative to its population at 17.1254%, highlighting the urgency for targeted measures in heavily affected regions. In contrast, Tanzania demonstrated the lowest infection rate with a mere 0.0008%, suggesting successful containment strategies.

The impact of COVID-19 on mortality rates was evident, with the United States of America and North America experiencing the highest death counts per population. The United States recorded a total of 576,232 deaths, underscoring the severity of the virus's impact in the country. Similarly, North America as a continent faced significant challenges. These findings emphasize the critical need for effective measures and healthcare strategies to mitigate the impact of the virus on both national and regional levels.

On a global scale, the total number of COVID-19 cases reached 150,574,977, resulting in approximately 2.112% deaths. These figures highlight the significant toll of the pandemic and the ongoing importance of comprehensive global efforts to combat the spread and minimize the mortality rate associated with COVID-19.

By leveraging these insights, we can better understand the varying risks, transmission rates, and impacts of COVID-19 across different regions, empowering us to make informed decisions and implement targeted strategies to mitigate the virus's impact and protect public health worldwide.
